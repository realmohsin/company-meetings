# Meeting Shape
{ 
  hostName, 
  hostUid,
  hostPhotoURL,
  createdAt,
  title,
  date,
  duration,
  department,
  building,
  room,
  attendees
}

# User Profile
{ 
  createdAt,
  uid,
  username,
  email,
  photoURL,
  photos,
  [added by settings]
}


user profile will at minimum have uid, username, email, createdAt

For Auth Errors, replace header with the error instead of jarring error box in the middle of the modal.

set width based positioning for navdropdown, is extremely small when username is small

- reset error state on componentWillUnmount?

- add reducer cases for error actiontypes

Todo: 
✔️ change password page
✔️ photos page
✔️ activity feed
✔️ realtime chat for meeting page
- styling
- production optimizations

optional things to do:
split meetings part of profile into 3 side by side sections on max width
- refactor createmeeting and editmeeting to share duplicate code


last major things to do:
- meeting page css
- guard routes & guard modal
- photo uploading bug
- add redirect-to-top-of-page library
- modals responsive
- code splitting optimization
